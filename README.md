# Dice Rolling Simulation
This mini poject involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. The program will print what that number is. It should then ask you if youâ€™d like to roll again. 
In another version, I've added the simulated dice's number of the number rolled shown on that side of the dice using the python dictionary feature.
